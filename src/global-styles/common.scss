// CSS Pro Tips 02.01.2021 Notes

/* 1. Use :root for flexible type.
      The type font size in a responsive layout should be able to adjust with each viewport. You can calculate the
      font-size based on the viewport height and width using :root.
*/
:root {
  //font-size: calc(0.5vw + 0.5vh + 0.5vmin);
}


/* 2. Inherit box-sizing.
      Let box-sizing be inherited from html.
      This make it easier to change it when code is introduced through 3rd party plugins or applications that use
      different behavior.
 */
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  overflow: hidden;
  font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
}

*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}


/* 3. Add line-height to body.
      The one thing that leads to inefficient stylesheets is repeating declarations over and over again.
      Line-height is one property you can set for your entire project, not only to minimize lines of code, but to
      enforce a standard look to your site's typography.
      Rather than add line-height to each <p>, <h*> and so on, add it to body.
*/
body {
  // Utilize the root em unit based on the value calculated by :root.
  //font: 1rem / 1.5 sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
}


/* 4. Set font-size on form elements for a better mobile experience.
      To avoid mobile browsers (iOS Safari, et al.) from zooming in on html elements when a <select> dropdown is tapped,
      add font-size to the selector rule.
*/
input[type="text"],
input[type="number"],
select,
textarea {
  font-size: 1rem;
}


/* 5. Set :focus for form elements.
      Sighted keyboard users rely on focus to determine where keyboard events go in the page.
      Make focus for form elements stand out and consistent then a browser's default implementation.
 */
a,
button,
input,
textarea {
  &:focus {
    box-shadow: none;
    outline: #000000 dotted 2px;
    outline-offset: 0.05em;
  }
}


/* 6. Style broken images.
      Broken images happen for a number of reasons and are either unsightly or lead to confusion (just and empty element).
 */
img {
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;

  &:before {
    content: "We're sorry, the image is missing.";
    display: block;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }

  &:after {
    content: "(url: 'attr(src)')";
    display: block;
    font-size: 0.25rem;
  }
}

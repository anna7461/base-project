  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">The role of illustrations</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Illustration is a key element of the brand system.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our illustrations range from detailed hero images down to in-product spot images with
    a consistent narrative of practically, optimism, and friendliness used throughout. This is accomplished through
    shape, color, softness, and curves to achieve an inviting, engaging experience.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Illustrations can:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">make complex ideas more accessible</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">represent our brand - personality, voice, and platform - in an efficient and clear
        way</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">scale up or down depending on the context</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">affect tone and speak directly to users depending on the job to be done and the
        user's emotional state</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">help to tell stories and thoughtfully convey ideas - they should not be used as
        decoration or without consideration</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">When to use illustration in marketing</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use illustration across marketing touchpoints to support a cohesive, clear, and
    consistent story from start to finish. It's almost always used to support copy, and should never distract or
    overshadow the key message. Illustration plays a more prominent role in marketing than in product in order to help
    tell stories, and is most commonly used in the following places:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">websites, landing pages, microsites, service sites</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">presentations</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">demand generation assets (banner ads, etc)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">email</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">social media</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">infographic</p>
    </li>

      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">swag</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Illustration principles</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Consider the following principles for how we want to be perceived through
    illustrations.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Be bold</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our illustration style takes larger-than-life achievements and makes them human and
    relatable. Being bold means taking on massive goals, feeling empowered, and being confident that those goals are
    achievable. It's not about being loud, noisy, or over-the-top. It's about setting a goal and acknowledging the
    inherent complexity in getting things done. We use clean shapes, plenty of white space, and balanced color ratios to
    ensure that the scene never feels too chaotic.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Be optimistic</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our illustrations feature future-forward narratives that center around teams working
    together to improve the world around them. The Atlassian illustration style reflects our belief that a team is
    capable of tackling any task, no matter how big or complex. Stylistically, bright color and a sense of low-gravity
    lend a lightness and buoyancy to our storytelling, driving home the point that when we work together, anything is
    achievable.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Be practical, but with a wink</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Though our illustration style is slightly fantastical, it should never feel
    impractical or naive. We reinforce the real-life nature of teamwork through perspective and depth. We add in 'wink'
    through slight tweaks to the dimension of people and things. We ensure that the illustration narrative is both
    nspiring and empowering, which means that we thoughtfully use metaphors (such as unicorns) when appropriate, as well
    as clear, literal representations of real-life concepts.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Types of illustration</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Atlassian illustrations can be broken down into several categories:</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Hero</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Hero illustrations are intended to tell more complex stories. This allows them to be
    more metaphorical and fantastical in nature. The viewer should feel a sense of teamwork, adventure, achievement, and
    optimism. In the majority of cases, a central, larger-than-life object should be surrounded by a team working to
    build, fix, and assemble. Hero illustrations contain more than three people and their complexity should vary
    depending on the intended size.</p>

         alt="">
  </div>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Spot hero</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Spot heroes are slightly simplified versions of heroes, visually and metaphorically.
    These assets are perfect when you need to pack a punch with limited space. Often they are a slightly more literal
    representation of a single concept. Despite simplification, they still contain a small team working on or around a
    larger-than-life subject.</p>

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Spot</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Spot illustrations are the simplest and most literal expression of a concept. Because
    they are often used in the product as an empty state, or in a composition with other spot illustrations, they are
    small and simple. They usually do not include any people but occasionally include some atmospheric background
    elements, depending on the design.</p>

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Meeples</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Meeples are a category in and of themselves and are created at both high and low
    fidelities for optimum flexibility. They can be used on their own, but are often combines with other
    illustrations.</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Full-size meeples</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">When you talk about 'Bob', 'a customer', 'my team' or 'me', you need something more
    immediately relatable than low-fi pieces of a larger concept. For this reason, full-size meeples are more human and
    are designed to register as actual people versus concepts of people.</p>

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Simplified meeples</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">When is tight, or a configuration calls for complexity, use simplified meeples so that
    individuals and teams can be displayed at a lower fidelity.</p>

  <div class="media-wrapper mb-16">

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Meeple scenes</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Sometimes, we need to depict individuals in environments that tell a story and set
    context. For this, you can use high-fi meeple scenes. These scenes set meeples in relatable environments, which are
    helpful when you are trying to show personal interactions.</p>

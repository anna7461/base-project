  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Consistent use of a grid system provides the foundation for harmoniously and
    consistently positioning elements onscreen. Designing to the grid helps create an experience that facilitates
    understanding and brings order to the page.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The grid can be applied through the page component in the <a href="#">Atlaskit
    library</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Baseline grid and vertical rhythm</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The Atlassian type stack specifies 14px for the base font size, which produces an 8-px
    x-height. The x-height is halved to produce a 4px baseline. All text flows vertically along this baseline, creating
    a similar rhythm across all screens. This rhythm is created by the line height between each line of text and the
    margin between elements.</p>

      alt="">
  </div>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">This baseline convention naturally flows on the rest of the grid system, which
    includes icons, components, and layout dimensions. Always try to align objects on the 8px grid, but where necessary
    use good judgement to fine tune your designs to 4px. The 4px baseline is there to allow more flexibility for line
    heights and smaller adjustments.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Best practices</h5>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Use multiples of 8px when defining measurements, spacing, and positioning
        elements.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">When necessary use 4px to make more fine tuned adjustments.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Whenever possible, make sure that objects line up, both vertically and
        horizontally.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Align your bounding box to the grid, not the baseline of your text.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Layout with the horizontal grid</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We define a horizontal grid for content and UI elements to align to, creating a visual
    structure with content. We prefer this over relying heavily on boxes and lines around content as it reduces the
    amount of elements a user needs to scan in order to digest ehat they see. We believe the amount of elements a user
    needs to scan in order to digest what they see. We believe that the user's content should be the main focus of a
    page, so we reduce all unnecessary distractions.</p>

  <ol class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Global navigation</strong>: Minimum width of 60px.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Container navigation</strong>: Minimum width of 240px.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Content</strong>: Adaptive width.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Gutter</strong>: Fixed spacing between columns.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Column</strong>: Guides what the content aligns to.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">In our grid system we reserve space for the navigation on the left, and apply a
    center-aligned 12-column adaptive layout to the content. You can apply a fixed width or a fluid grid layout. The
    fixed-width layout has a max-width of 960px and is useful for long form content. The fluid layout full-screen works
    better for screens that are data or interaction heavy.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">You can combine multiple blocks of fixed and fluid layout underneath each other on a
    single screen. This is useful when you want to combine a piece of long form text with a code block that would be the
    full width of the screen.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Both layouts are adaptive. This means column widths will react to whether the
    navigation is expanded or not, and columns will scale according to available screen real estate. When screen drops
    below the max-width of the fixed layout, both grid types effectively look the same.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Gutter spacing</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The gutters in between columns have a fixed width and only scale when the text size
    scales to maintain a distinct and legible separation of content. There are three different gutter sizes to allow for
    different types of content spacing: compact, cozy, and comfortable.</p>

  </ol>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Column layout and text</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Layouts in our products are generally in an eight or 12 column configuration. The
    simplest layout is a centered, single block that spans eight columns. Alternatively, the layout can be extended to
    use the remaining four columns if there is a need for primary and secondary information.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Using the default font size value in the Atlassian type stack, we can optimize the max
    width of paragraphs for a comfortable reading experience. There's an overall maximum width set in the layout to
    ensure that the line length of text does not exceed a readable measure of 100 characters per line. At 14px, the
    recommended line length falls at eight columns. With the exception of code, text blocks should not be set across
    more than that.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Best practices</h5>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Keep layouts simple. Consider a single block of eight columns or two blocks of
        eight and four basic layout.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Maximum line length should span up to eight columns, which is the ideal size for
        all content types. Do not go over this size for normal text.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Server</h4>

<div class="page-content">
  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Use focused, meaningful color to pinpoint exactly what people need to see. We are
    committed to complying with the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast
      ratios</a>.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">To do this, choose primary, secondary, and extended colors that support usability by
    ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use our products.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Primary palette</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our primary palette is comprised of neutrals, white, and blue to bring boldness to our
    brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important
    bits. We pepper warmer, secondary palette colors throughout to soften the experience and to impart confidence and
    optimism.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use blue (B400) for primary actions, buttons, text links, for indicating progress
    and representing authentication. Neutral (N800) is used primarily for body text and headings, and white (N0) is used
    for page backgrounds.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Secondary palette</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and
    interesting. We lean on these colors more frequently when brand awareness is high, or on our own properties where we
    control the surrounding environment. When used in conjunction with our primary palette, these colors make every
    moment
    feel on-brand and every interaction informative.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our secondary palette is made up of red (R300), yellow (Y300), green (G300), teal
    (T300), and purple (P300). Each color is selected intentionally to provide meaningful feedback within our products.
    See the semantic color guidelines below for more information.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Extended palette</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The extended palette consists of all the usable tints and shades of each color in the
    palette. They are all numbered for easy reference. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but
    they come in handy for illustrations and components in product.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Neutrals</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Neutrals have varying degrees of saturation that allow for the appropriate level of
    warmth across marketing and product. Typically they are used for text and subtle backgrounds when we don't want to
    draw too much attention to a particular touch-point or convey information such as "to do" or "disabled".</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Dark neutrals</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Dark neutrals are very effective for creating contrast and are therefore the primary
    color used for typography. Occasionally the dark neutrals are found in illustration but they rarely dominate the
    palette. Some exceptions are dark mode UI elements and illustrations.</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Mid neutrals</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Use mid-neutrals to create depth in components such as modal dialog blankets and
    cards. Avoid mid-neutrals as background colors because there is usually not enough contrast to remain AA
    compliant. The mid-neutrals N400 to N200 can be used for subtle text and icons on light-neutral backgrounds. You can
    find text style using these colors in
    <a href="#">Typography</a>.</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">Light neutrals</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use light neutrals as subtle backgrounds to indicate various interactive states
    such as hover and disabled, or simply to create secondary attention towards a component. You'll find light neutrals
    in buttons, text fields, tags and illustrations.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Light neutrals are helpful for offsetting content in a primarily white layout without
    losing warmth and cleanliness and are therefore often used as a background color. Their subtlety allows for them to
    be helpful in depicting illustrative objects that are typically made of metallic materials like hardware, or
    atmospheric elements in illustrations, like clouds.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Red</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Red is mainly used for backgrounds in messages and in error states to draw attention
    to important information or actions that are destructive or block workflow. You'll find red used in components such
    as lozenges, flag messages, buttons, illustrations, and typography.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Yellow</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Yellow indicates a warning or that progress is impeded. Yellow feels right at home in
    components like lozenges, banners, flag messages, and buttons.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Green</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use green to indicate success or to celebrate a win. Green goes well with lozenges,
    badges, toggles, messages, and illustrations. Keep in mind that our green is very vibrant, which can cause eye
    strain in large doses. However, because of this vibrancy, it can also stand out well among many other elements on a
    page, which is why it is a good choice for call-to-action and buttons in marketing.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Blue</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Blue is used to help us reinforce our presence and unify our touch points from
    marketing to product. It's sharp and clear, making it bold and optimistic, while at the same time it's soft and
    inviting, paying homage to the practical, human origins of Atlassian. It is at the heart of every communication and
    should be used intentionally but sparingly. As with all colors in the palette, appropriately and accurately, the
    colors have an incredible impact.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Blue is used to indicate authentication, connectivity, or progress. You'll find blue
    in messages, buttons, navigation, lozenges, badges, tabs, and the progress tracker.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Teal</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Teal can typically be found in illustrations or as an accent color for components such
    a tags.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Purple</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Purple indicates help and support and is used in spotlight, buttons, messages,
    lozenges, and image callouts. It is also used to display visited links in web typography and as an accent color in
    illustration. However, it is best used in small doses in illustration as it can sometimes clash with blue.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Semantic color</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The following guidelines outline when to use colors in product. Semantic color helps
    users find people, identify status, see actions, locate help, and understand next steps. The consistent use of color
    keeps cognitive load low and makes for a unified and engaging user experience. In addition to the color usage
    guidelines for web, there are also iOS and Android application color guidelines that augment the color guidelines
    for those platforms.</p>

  <p class="content-description text-light-grey mb-20">Accessible design lets people of all abilities interact with,
    understand, and navigate our products.</p>
</div>

<div class="page-content">
  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Products and web properties need to be accessible to everyone, including those with
    vision, hearing, cognitive, or motor impairments.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Accessible design is everyone's responsibility, from information and user experience
    design, though to development, and on into help and support. It is about understanding the user's journeys and
    proactively anticipating their needs.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">To make sure products are accessible to everyone, follow <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head" target="_blank">the four
    principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>:</p>

  <ol class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">
        <strong>Perceivable:</strong> It can be perceived by at least one of a person's
        senses.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">
        <strong>Operable:</strong> All interactions are operable through a variation of input
        methods.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">
        <strong>Understandable:</strong> Information and operation of the interface must be understandable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">
        <strong>Robust:</strong> Content can be interpreted by a variety of assistive
        technologies and withstand changes in these technologies.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Structure and hierarchy</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Consistent, clear hierarchy helps people who navigate the page using links or headers.
    Use headings and titles to outline the page so people can see the structure and how sections relate to each
    other.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Be predictable with structure and use patterns and layouts familiar to people.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Content should be visible, so avoid putting important information inside
    accordions.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">List by level of importance</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Place items on the page in order of their level of importance so people don't have to
    search for them.</p>

  <div class="media-wrapper mb-24">
    <img
      src="https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/1ohrvGHnKzbhxd8utk4prH/fcf640a76cc8386cad50f38c220f515d/accessibility-list-by-level.png"
      alt="">
  </div>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Have a consistent hierarchy</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Create and maintain a consistent hierarchy so that people can use alternative input
    methods to move through the page. Headings are in order without skipping levels.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [doText]="'Use a consistent heading hierarchy: H1, H2, H3, H4'"
    [dontText]="'Use headings out of order: H2, H1, H3, H3'"
  ></app-do-dont>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Text scaling</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Test the UI to ensure the layout works for different languages and assistive
    technologies. Consider languages that reuquire longer text fields and text wrapping. Also consider how the UI looks
    at
    200% magnification.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Group similar items</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Group items under titles or headings that clearly communicate the content of the
    group.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [media]="true"
    [doMedia]="'https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/2KbmC4Fkr7Eqg5742nPv1I/66ecd378cf88e161f89227e65de1fd16/similar-items-do.png'"

  ></app-do-dont>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Keyboard navigation</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Some people can't use a mouse and navigate through applications using tools such as a
    keyboard, mouth wand, or eye tracking system. People should be able to navigate and use the product with a keyboard
    or
    screen reader. Make sure anything that can be seen by hovering with a mouse is also accessible to keyboard focus and
    screen readers.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">When creating an application, check if a keyboard can be used to:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">navigate</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">perform the same tasks as people who use a mouse</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">locate where you are on the page</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">tell where the keyboard focus is</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Manage focus</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Keyboard focus follows the page as the eye would scan it. Focus travels top to bottom,
    left to right, moving from most to least important item. People can navigate applications using alternative input
    methods (D-pads, trackballs, keyboards, and navigation gestures), and the focus flows in a logical order.</p>

  <div class="media-wrapper">
    <img
      src="https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/l35rmxIrBTvhfbnGFPRkc/5cec94c5ba4c05a919a9d0a615696100/accessibility-list-by-level.png"
      alt="">
  </div>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">When assessing keyboard focus:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Be conscious of the order of elements on the page. Do they make sense the user's
        perspective?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Indicate where focus is.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Avoid using input focus to select, trigger events, or display messages. People
        may need to navigate through all controls before making changes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Keep in mind where the focus moves when the element in focus disappears. People
        should return to wherever they were before they focused on the element.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Use tooltips</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16"><a href="#">Tooltips</a> can be activated by keyboard. When an element gets keyboard
    focus, a tooltip displays. When that element loses focus, the tooltip disappears.</p>

  <div class="media-wrapper">

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Validate forms inline</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Validate forms inline so keyboard users don't have to navigate fat to get
    feedback.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Ideally, design interactions to prevent errors happening in the first place and help
    people fix problems as tey occur.</p>

  <div class="media-wrapper">

      alt="">
  </div>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Meaningful text</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Consistent and helpful text makes the user interface accessible to people who use a
    screen reader. Screen readers help people with visual impairments by reading both visible and non-visible
    alternative
    text aloud.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">All text should support accessibility, whether it's visible (UI labels, headings,
    buttons, forms, hyperlinks, and help text) or non-visible (alternative text for images and buttons).</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Be concise and use plain English</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Keep content and accessibility text concise. People using screen readers hear every
    UI
    element read aloud, so the shorter the text, the faster they can navigate the content.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Screen readers can skim more easily and skip irrelevant paragraphs if you keep
    sentences short and frontload paragraphs with important information.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Plain English helps people skim and digest information faster. It also makes content
    more accessible to those who speak English as a seconds, third or fourth language.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Avoid idioms and always expand acronyms when using them for the first time.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Use consistent labels</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Consistency label elements and components that have the same functionality. When
    people
    encounter these elements in different contexts, they should be able to recognize and understand the function or
    actions of an element. For instance, a menu item that is labeled <i>All sprints</i> should open a page that is
    titled
    <i>All sprints</i>. A dialogue with the title <i>Copy page</i> has a button labeled <i>Copy</i>.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [media]="true"
    [doMedia]="'https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/mCv6KDudrcG92WUXhBJld/d94fbf3a810c87cebe7d370f03fb6034/accessibility-label-do.png'"
    [doText]="'Title Copy page with a button labeled Copy.'"

    [dontText]="'Title Copy page with a button labeled Duplicate.'"
  ></app-do-dont>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Describe what an element does</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Label elements with action verbs that indicate what happens when the element is
    selected.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [doText]="'Edit preferences - When read aloud, the text indicates the action.'"
    [dontText]="'Preferences - Just labeling the element doesn\'t make it clear what will happen when it is selected.'"
  ></app-do-dont>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Buttons</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">In buttons, describe what the action does and, if you can, reveal what will
    happen.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [doText]="'Add room'"
    [dontText]="'Go for it!'"
  ></app-do-dont>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Hyperlinks and skip links</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Link text should indicate where the link navigates to. When linking text we use "Learn
    more" along with a description of where we are taking the user. Link your entire message. For in-app or in-product
    links don't use a
    <a href="#">period (full stop)</a> at the end of the sentence.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">E.g. <a href="#">Learn more about Jira permissions</a></p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Linking the entire message gives users context about the link destination lowering
    their
    cognitive load.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">These links take a user who is visually impaired through hearing a screen reader
    repeat
    "Learn more" at this time while tabbing through a page. Linking the full message also helps navigation using screen
    readers and allows the text to stand alone.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Add skip links or anchors to help people navigate around content pages.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Images and video</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">For important information, use text rather than images. Only use images that usefully
    add to the text.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Describe non-text elements in the UI or with alternative text so screen readers can
    succinctly describe images and media.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Avoid moving or flashing images if possible.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Images that contain information</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">If an image contains information that can only be understood bt seeing the image, then
    you need to explain the content of the image using alternative text. Follow these guidelines when you write alt
    text.</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">The text should be an adequate replacement for both the content and the function of
        the image.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Determine the correct content and then deliver that message as succintly as
        possible. Aim for no more than a few words, though sometimes a short sentence or two may be necessary.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Don't repeat information that is contained in the text found on the page around the
        image.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Don't use phrases like "image of ..." or "a photo of ..." to describe the image.
        This is apparent when using screen readers and the description itself should be enough to replace the meaning of
        the image.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">If the meaning and content of an image is conveyed by surrounding text, header, or
        captions, then you might not need as much alternative text.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Decorative images</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">If the image is used strictly make the page pleasant to the eye, doesn't contain a
    link,
    and isn't used to deliver information, then include the alt attribute, but leave it empty. For example,
    <i>alt=""</i>
  </p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Complex images</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">A complex image could be a diagram, table or chart. Depending on the level of
    complexity,
    the image may need text near it explaining the contents, short alt text that complements this and possibly a link to
    a
    pge with a long text description.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Videos</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Provide transcripts and in-sync captioning. Make sure users can control when the video
    or gif starts and stops.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Provide audio description for any text displayed in a video.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Colors</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We comply with <a href="#">AA standard contrast ratios</a>. To do this, we choose
    primary, secondary and extended colors that support usability. This ensures sufficient color contrast between
    elements
    so that people with low vision can see and use our products.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20">Include multiple visual cues</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Don't convey information using color alone. Use multiple visual cues, such as stroke
    weight, patterns, shape, text, or illustrations to ensure that everyone receives the same information. This helps
    people who are unable to, or have difficulty with, distinguishing one color from another. This includes people who
    are
    color blind, have low vision, or are blind.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">For example, these inline validation messages use both color and icons to distinguish
    severity:</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [media]="true"
    [doMedia]="'https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/1ca4TtV0x1mVTO1SGh1706/8b0902958ec4628983f29245bb3dbe14/visual-cue-do.png'"
    [dontMedia]="'https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/4ytqS9iIEfy0I8RnbvLbmC/2f31f6b4583cf8db6f8e6fde1e249d01/visual-cue-dont.png'"
    [doText]="'The success message used a tick icon and is green in color. The error message uses an exclamation point and is\n'+
'      red in color.'"
    [dontText]="'Color is the only visual cue to distinguish severity. The success message is green in color. The error message is\n'+
'      red in color.'">
  </app-do-dont>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Use high contrast</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">High color contrast helps people who are partially or completely color blind see
    differences between certain colors. It creates a strong visual hierarchy and improves usability for everyone. Make
    sure that the combination of text and background color do not fall below the
    <a href="#">WCAG recommended threshold</a> ratio of 4.5:1 for standard text and 3:1 for larger text.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Decorative images and disabled states don't have contrast requirements.</p>

  <app-do-dont
    [media]="true"
    [doMedia]="'https://images.ctfassets.net/8j5aqoy0ts8s/6r8LGI1pzLHIFxAL34VTIw/7c6b2d15a8c394df4b4cfd58a9c18fd4/accessibility-contrast-do.png'"
    [doText]="'Use high contrast color combinations that pass AA compliance.'"

    [dontText]="'Don\'t use low contrast color combinations that fail AA compliance.'"
  ></app-do-dont>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Testing and research</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">These guidelines will help improve accessibility in your applications, but they don't
    guarantee a fully accessible experience. We also recommend you:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">test the entire application and journeys using various assistive technologies and
        text scaling</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">include people with impairments when testing</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">ensure in doubt, refer to the <a href="#">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        2.1</a>.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce
    cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section. Use them infrequently -
    if you're questioning an icon's use, it probably doesn't need to be used at all.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our icons are designed with our brand personality baked in, aiming to balance our
    human side with function.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">As a general rule, icons should be used in combination with meaningful text to support
    users progressing through the product in an accessible manner. However, avoid aria-labels if you are rendering the
    icon with visible text to prevent accessibility label duplication.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">There are few widely recognized icons, so whenever possible, use a label or supporting
    text to ensure its meaning is understood. In this case, an aria-label will be used for the icon.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Find out more about writing meaningful text in our <a href="#">accessibility
    guidelines.</a></p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Combining unfamiliar icons with text could confuse users depending on how they
    recognize the supporting icon, so make sure the icon and text label are coupled. To help enhance usability further,
    ensure the icon color has at least a
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard
      color contrast ratio.</a></p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Avoid using icons solely for decoration or visual interest as it detracts from their
    intention elsewhere. Consider the surrounding context of icons too; if icons are cluttered and not spaced well, it
    can lead to more visual noise and confusion.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Internationalization</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Always consider icons from a global perspective. Whenever possible, use an
    internationally recognized icon in place of a locally recognized icon that may only apply to a specific background
    or culture such as a local currency symbol, <€ ¥ £, rather than always using $.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Platform specifics</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our icons can be used across web, iOS, Android, and macOS to represent similar
    concepts. Some icons, however, are already established conventions on specific platforms. In these cases, follow the
    conventions for the operating system using the OS-specific guidance.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">You can search for icons by filename or by usage in our <a
    href="https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/design-system/icon" target="_blank">icon explorer in
    Atlaskit</a>. There are three types of icons in our design system:</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Standard icons</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Standard sized icons are used as visual representations of common actions and commands
    to provide additional context and enhance usability. These icons can be scaled up or down in size if necessary.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Object icons</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Object icons are specifically used to represent an object specific to an Atlassian
    product, such as 'bug' in Jira or 'pull request' in Bitbucket. These icons are different from standard icons and
    file type icons.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">File type icons</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Files type icons are often used in the same context as most other Object icons. There
    are common file types (txt, mp3, mov, etc), and third party integrations' file types (docx, ai, sketch, etc).</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Style</h4>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Variations</h5>

  <div class="media-wrapper mb-16">

      alt="">
  </div>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our icons have variations to work within a given context. There will be a line
    version, which can be accompanied by a filled version. Use the line version of our icon in most cases as they are
    visually balanced, so more than one can be used when close together.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Often, a filled version can be used to represent an action or command that has been
    carried out, such as using a filled start when a post has been "favorited". You can use color to further reinforce
    this interaction and change.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Size</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">There are three icon sizes in our design system:</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">16px (small)</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Small icons are best used when space is limited. We use small icons in our components
    such as a chevron-down in the select component or a cross-circle filled in populated text fields.</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">24px (medium)</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Medium icons are used in the majority of our interface. These are our standard
    size.</p>

  <h6 class="heading-6 mb-20 pt-20">32px (large)</h6>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Large icons are used sparingly to emphasize a concept or when space is plentiful.
    Wherever it's used, consider the fidelity of the icon in the space it's being used. (If there's plenty of room, a
    spot illustration might be more appropriate).</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Color</h5>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our icons are available to use as a single color. N500 is the default color and N70 is
    used for disabled states. For components containing confirmations, alerts, information, and acknowledgements, follow
    the guidelines associated with the component and use case.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Using icons with a text label and color will enhance the usability and <a
    href="#">accessibility</a> for all users.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Server</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">AUI icons use different sizing and certain icons may not be available. See the <a
    href="https://aui.atlassian.com/aui/latest/docs/icons.html" target="_blank">AUI documentation on icons</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Atlassian's font stack</h4>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Brand typography</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use our custom font, Charlie Sans, for almost everything brand and marketing - from
    banner ads to billboards. It was designed to be incredibly versatile with lots of range in terms of tone and
    playfulness. It can be quirky and expressive when it needs to be, or neutral when the situation calls for something
    a bit more serious. On rare occasions, we also use native typography for selected elements.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Charlie is available in two styles, Display and Text.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Product typography</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use native typography for all in-product experiences. This ensures that the UI is
    optimized to be highly legible, performs well, and is frictionless as you move between Atlassian products and the
    rest of the system.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Font stacks</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">We use sans serif fonts for most of our type-in-product, the exception being when you
    want to display code then you should defer to monospace fonts.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Sans serif</h5>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Monospaced</h5>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Usage</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Keeping typography consistent and sticking to logical hierarchies ensures that
    elements in the UI are clear and easily recognizable when scanning the page. Text sizes, styles, and layouts were
    selected to balance content and UI and to foster familarity.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The default appearance of typography in Atlassian Design System uses the UI
    properties. The use of long form properties is up to individual products.</p>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Formatting</h5>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Line length</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Set the reading environment to suit the reader. Wide lines of text are difficult to
    read and make it harder for people to focus. While there is no right way to measure the perfect width for text, a
    good goal is to aim for between 60 and 100 characters per line including spacing. Setting an optimal line length
    will break up content into easily digestible information.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Readers may also have control over the layout width, meaning that a line length can
    not always be specified. So, it's good practice to design for an ideal line length range under normal
    circumstances, and use responsive design techniques to anticipate different contexts.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">When displaying content in a fluid layout, set the max-width (680 in the example
    below). When the viewport is resized and the content has reached the max-width, the container will continue to
    expand with even margins on wither side. When the viewport has been resized and the content is below the max-width,
    the content will snap to 100% of the container with the specified margins on either side.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Service and educational typography</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Our service sites use a mixture of both marketing and product typography and it
    assessed on a case-by-case depending on the following considerations:</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Please work directly with the Creative & Design teams when assessing typography for
    these types of properties.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Third-party services and portals</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Atlassian relies on several third-party services to provide content and information to
    Atlassian employees, partners, and sometimes, users. Most information in mot third-party portals and services should
    maintain their <strong>native styling</strong>. This means that we should not override most of the default elements,
    styles or layouts. However, there are several Atlassian brand assets that can be used to imply authorship,
    endorsement, or affiliation with a given service.</p>

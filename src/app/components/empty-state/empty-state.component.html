  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Usage</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">Empty states show when there is nothing to display in a view, for example, when a
    board has no tasks, someone clears their inbox, or a search returns no results.</p>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">An empty state can appear as a full screen message or within panels, tables, and other
    containers. Empty states are often a chance to celebrate, educate, and inform people of what they can do next.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Anatomy</h4>

  </div>

  <ol class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Illustration</strong>: A spot illustration that relates to the message
        literally or as a metaphor (see illustration best practices below).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Header</strong>: A title that provides a concise description of the current
        state.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Message</strong>: A short message describing the reason for the state and
        what to do next. See content guidelines below for details.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8"><strong>Actions</strong>: Next steps or a way to dismiss the message. Can be a
        primary button (blue), secondary button (grey), or link-styled button (tertiary).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Behavior</h4>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">This component has two width options for containers of different sizes:</p>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">The default width, <code>wide</code>, is 464px. This is based on six columns in the
        cozy
        <a href="#">grid system</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">The <code>narrow</code> size shrinks the text width to 304px. That's four columns
        in the cozy
        <a href="#">grid system</a>. Consider this for empty states in containers smaller than the default width.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="paragraph-text mb-16">The only required part of the empty state component is the heading, which uses h600
    heading type. If this doesn't fit your case, you may have to consider another component or custom design. See the
    <a href="#">grid</a> and <a href="#">typography</a> foundations for more guidelines.</p>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Best practices</h4>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Include an action or link to help the user recover and find what to do next.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Consider all scenarios that could cause the empty state to occur.</p>

      <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">The first time someone views an empty board (blank slate) might call for an
            inspirational, motivating, or educational tone.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">An empty state that appears when a user finishes all their tasks could have a
            more celebratory tone and illustration.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">A general no-result state (such as no search results) might be more neutral,
            but still motivate by showing next steps.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="heading-5 mb-20 pt-32">Illustrations</h5>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">This component is optimized for <a href="#">spot illustrations</a>. Don’t resize
        spot heroes or other larger illustrations to fit a smaller space.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Make sure the image is relevant to the current task and context. Some spot images
        are designed specifically for empty states.</p>

      <ul class="mb-24 pl-58">
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">If there isn’t a relevant illustration in the library, internal Atlassians can
            request one through the
            <a href="#">illustration request process</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Choose an image that has a neutral or humorous tone (never negative).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Illustrations are optional. Consider leaving out the illustration if there are
        other visuals that might be competing on one screen, or if the space is too small for a spot illustration.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Content guidelines</h4>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Always use sentence case for titles and headings.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Try to limit the number of words in the message as much as possible. Remember that
        most people scan text instead of reading everything.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Keep call to action (CTA) buttons short, and use imperative verbs such as <strong>Try</strong>,
        <strong>Remove</strong>, or <strong>Create</strong> to describe what action people can take next.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Be mindful of how many CTAs might appear on one page.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">See all writing guidelines on <a href="#">empty state CTAs</a>./p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Empty states are often an opportunity to teach or give more information, especially
        if it’s the first time a user see’s a screen. Avoid sending people to another location for more information, but
        if it can't be avoided, use a <strong>Learn more</strong> link (see the tertiary action prop for implementation
        details).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Consider the user’s emotional state and context. An empty state may be an
        opportunity to celebrate, educate, add some “wink,” or convey a sense of accomplishment. When crafting your
        message, see the <a href="#">Atlassian voice and tone principles for empty states</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="heading-4 mb-20 pt-48">Accessibility</h4>

  <ul class="mb-24 pl-48">
    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Use alternative text for illustrations.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Avoid jargon and use simple language.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Make links as descriptive as possible.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Make text easily scannable to highlight key information.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="paragraph-text mb-8">Follow all <a href="#">accessibility foundations</a> for accessible design.</p>
    </li>
